--- Render-verification suite for the Python REST service archetype: each persistence variant lays
--- out correctly and is fully rendered, and the hollow (None) rendering stays hollow.
---
--- Every rendering comes from `p6m.spec{}` + `p6m.render` — the shape harness — so the paths this
--- file expects are BUILT from the same identity the archetype was answered with, never spelled by
--- hand. A hand-spelled path list is how `.../items.py` outlived the entity it was named for.
---
--- The BEHAVIORAL bar — CRUD through the production image, the platform env contract, health/
--- metrics/structured logs, both name shapes — lives in proofs/standards.prova.lua, which also owns
--- S10 CI parity. No host toolchain is invoked here (S8b): compile coverage is containerized, and
--- the hollow rendering is proven by building its production Dockerfile below.
